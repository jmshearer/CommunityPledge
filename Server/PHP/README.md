# PHP Receiver

1. Copy `receiveData.php` to server

2. Modify `receiveData.php` as needed to store the data (as written, it is just stored to a log file but a more practical application would involve a database such as MySQL)

3. Update `reportingUrl` in `config.js` with the URL of the hosted receiveData.php file.
